**Current Status:** All 16 tests passing ✅
**Next Steps:** ✅ Integrate service with main extension and implement actual window title updates

### 2025-06-24 - Extension Integration & Git Support
**What Changed:** Integrated WindowTitleService into main extension with git branch detection and configuration support
**Why:** Complete the core functionality and make extension functional for end users

**Files Modified:**
- `src/extension.ts` - Integrated WindowTitleService into main extension activation

- ✅ Error handling for edge cases

**Configuration Options:**
- `entitled.enableCustomTitle` (boolean) - Enable/disable custom title formatting
- `entitled.titlePattern` (string) - Custom pattern with variables

**Current Status:** Extension fully functional with all tests passing ✅

### 2025-06-24 - Enhanced Development Configuration
**What Changed:** Improved VS Code development experience with enhanced launch configurations and build tasks
**Why:** Better debugging experience and more efficient development workflow

**Configuration Improvements:**

`.vscode/launch.json` enhancements:

**Current Status:** Development environment optimized for efficient VS Code extension development ✅

### 2025-06-24 - File Exclusion & Packaging Optimization
**What Changed:** Enhanced `.gitignore` and `.vscodeignore` files for proper file exclusion and optimized packaging
**Why:** Ensure clean version control, smaller package size, and proper separation of development vs. distribution files

**File Exclusion Improvements:**

`.gitignore` enhancements:
- ✅ Comprehensive build output exclusions (`out/`, `dist/`, `build/`)
- ✅ Complete Node.js ecosystem exclusions (cache, logs, temp files)
- ✅ Environment file protection (`.env*`)
- ✅ OS-specific file exclusions (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
- ✅ IDE file exclusions (`.idea/`, swap files)

- ✅ Package now builds without warnings

**Final Package Contents:**
```
entitled-0.0.1.vsix (11.35 KB)

- **Development Efficiency** - IDE and OS files properly ignored

**Current Status:** File management and packaging fully optimized ✅

## Production & CI/CD Phase

### 2025-06-24 - Git Repository Setup & Initial Publish
**What Changed:** Initialized Git repository, committed all code, and pushed to GitHub
**Why:** Version control is essential for collaboration and provides foundation for CI/CD automation

**Repository Setup:**
- ✅ Initialized Git repository with proper .gitignore
- ✅ Created initial commit with complete codebase
- ✅ Set up GitHub remote repository at `https://github.com/ashurtech/entitled`

**Current Status:** Code successfully versioned and available on GitHub ✅

### 2025-06-24 - Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
**What Changed:** Built enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing, security, and publishing
**Why:** Professional development workflow ensures code quality, security, and seamless releases

**GitHub Actions Workflows Created:**

- ✅ Automated security monitoring and alerts
- ✅ Branch protection enforcement capabilities

**Current Status:** Enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline fully implemented ✅

### 2025-06-24 - CI/CD Pipeline Refinements & Fixes
**What Changed:** Resolved GitHub Advanced Security dependency issues and simplified version management
**Why:** Free repositories don't have GitHub Advanced Security, and version checking was overly restrictive for development

**Issues Resolved:**

**1. Dependency Review Limitation**
- ❌ **Problem:** `dependency-review-action` requires GitHub Advanced Security (paid feature)
- ✅ **Solution:** Disabled dependency review job for free repositories
- ✅ **Alternative:** npm audit + CodeQL + Snyk still provide comprehensive security coverage
- ✅ **Documentation:** Updated setup guides to reflect this limitation

**2. Version Check Complexity** 
- ❌ **Problem:** Automatic version validation was confusing and overly restrictive
- ✅ **Solution:** Removed version-check job from PR requirements
- ✅ **Benefit:** More flexible development workflow
- ✅ **Alternative:** Manual version management with optional automation

**Configuration Updates:**
- ✅ Updated branch protection documentation (removed `dependency-review` requirement)
- ✅ Simplified PR template (removed mandatory version bump requirement)
- ✅ Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect flexible version management
- ✅ Fixed `install-package` script to use current version (0.0.4)

**Simplified Workflow:**
- **Development:** Create features without mandatory version bumps
- **Publishing:** Version management can be done manually or via automation workflow
- **Security:** Still comprehensive with npm audit, CodeQL, and optional Snyk
- **Quality:** Full linting, testing, and compilation checks maintained

**Final Pipeline Features:**
- ✅ Multi-Node.js testing and validation
- ✅ Security scanning (npm audit + CodeQL + optional Snyk)
- ✅ Automated marketplace publishing on merge
- ✅ GitHub releases with artifacts
- ✅ Weekly dependency updates
- ✅ Manual version bump automation available
- ✅ Professional templates and documentation

**Current Status:** CI/CD pipeline refined and production-ready ✅

### Window Title Customization Feature
**Requirements:**

1. Primary: Set window title to: workspace/folder name + branch + filename + "VSCode"
2. Secondary: Allow custom title pattern composition

**Implementation Strategy:**

- ✅ Start with tests defining expected behavior
- ✅ Create WindowTitleService class
- ✅ Integrate with VS Code window API
- ✅ Add configuration options

**Current Status:** Core functionality complete, CI/CD pipeline operational ✅

## Current Version - v0.0.4

### 2025-06-24 - Added Repository Name Variable
**What Changed:** Added `{repo}` variable for git repository name extraction
**Why:** Provides distinction between workspace folder name and actual git repository name, useful when they differ
**Files Modified:**

- Updated `src/services/WindowTitleService.ts`:
  - Added `repo` to `TitleComponents` interface
  - Implemented `extractRepoName()` method with multiple extraction strategies
  - Updated `gatherTitleComponents()` to include repository name
  - Updated `composeCustomTitle()` to handle `{repo}` variable
- Updated `package.json`:
  - Added `{repo}` to configuration description
- Updated `src/test/suite/windowTitleService.test.ts`:
  - Added repo property to all test components
  - Added test for repository name extraction
  - Added test for `{repo}` variable in custom patterns

**How It Works:**
- Extracts repository name from VS Code's git API when available
- Falls back to .git directory inspection
- Parses remote origin URL to extract repository name from various formats
- Returns empty string if not a git repository

**Usage Example:**
```json
{
  "entitled.titlePattern": "{repo} [{branch}] {filename} (last: {timestamp})"
}
```

### 2025-06-24 - Added Fallback Pattern Support

**What Changed:** Implemented fallback pattern syntax with `||` operator for robust title patterns

**Why:** Provides graceful degradation when preferred variables are empty, making title patterns more flexible and reliable

**Files Modified:**

- Updated `src/services/WindowTitleService.ts`:
  - Completely rewrote `composeCustomTitle()` to handle fallback patterns
  - Added `getVariableValue()` helper method for variable resolution
  - Added regex-based pattern matching for `{variable1 || variable2 || variable3}` syntax
- Updated `package.json`:
  - Added fallback syntax documentation to configuration description
- Updated `src/test/suite/windowTitleService.test.ts`:
  - Added 8 comprehensive tests covering all fallback scenarios
  - Tests cover single fallbacks, multiple fallbacks, spaces, edge cases

**How It Works:**

- Uses `||` operator for fallback chains: `{workspace || repo || filename}`
- Evaluates variables left-to-right, using first non-empty value
- Supports multiple fallback patterns in one title
- Handles whitespace gracefully around `||` operators
- Backwards compatible with existing single-variable patterns

**Usage Examples:**

```json
{
  "entitled.titlePattern": "{workspace || repo || filename} [{branch}] (last: {timestamp})"
}
```

This pattern will:
1. Use `workspace` if available
2. Fall back to `repo` if workspace is empty
3. Fall back to `filename` if both workspace and repo are empty
4. Always show branch and timestamp if available

**Real-world Benefits:**
- No more empty brackets when branch isn't available
- Reliable project identification even when workspace names differ from repo names
- Graceful handling of non-git projects
