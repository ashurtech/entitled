# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Setup Complete!

Your VS Code extension now has a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline! Here's what you need to do to activate everything:

## ✅ What's Already Working

- **GitHub Actions workflows** are live and ready
- **Automated testing** on every PR (Node.js 16, 18, 20)
- **Security scanning** with CodeQL
- **Dependency vulnerability checks**
- **Version validation** (requires version bump in PRs)
- **Automated releases** when merged to main

## 🔧 Required Setup (Do These Next)

### 1. Set Up Branch Protection Rules

Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`:

- ✅ Require a pull request before merging
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
- Required status checks:
  - `lint-and-test (16.x)`
  - `lint-and-test (18.x)`
  - `lint-and-test (20.x)`
  - `version-check`
  - `security-scan`
  ~~- `dependency-review`~~ (disabled - requires GitHub Advanced Security)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

### 2. Get VS Code Marketplace Token

**Required for automatic publishing!**

1. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Create a Personal Access Token:
   - Organization: All accessible organizations
   - Scope: **Marketplace (Manage)**
4. Copy the token
5. Go to GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
6. Add new repository secret:
   - Name: `VSCE_PAT`
   - Value: [paste your token]

### 3. Optional: Open VSX Token (for wider distribution)

1. Sign up at [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org)
2. Generate access token in your account settings
3. Add as `OVSX_PAT` secret in GitHub

### 4. Optional: Snyk Security Token

1. Sign up at [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io)
2. Get API token from account settings
3. Add as `SNYK_TOKEN` secret in GitHub

## 🎯 How to Use the Pipeline

### For Development

1. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
2. **Make changes**: Implement your feature
3. **Bump version**: Edit `package.json` version (required!)
4. **Create PR**: Push and create pull request
5. **CI runs**: All checks must pass
6. **Merge**: Automatic publish to marketplace!

### Version Bumping

**Every PR MUST bump the version in package.json!**

- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, backwards compatible  
- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes

Quick commands:
```bash
npm run version:patch  # 0.0.1 → 0.0.2
npm run version:minor  # 0.0.1 → 0.1.0
npm run version:major  # 0.0.1 → 1.0.0
```

## 🔄 Automated Features

### On Every PR
- ✅ Multi-Node.js version testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ ESLint checks  
- ✅ Security vulnerability scan
- ✅ Version bump validation
- ✅ Dependency safety review

### On Merge to Main
- ✅ Build and package extension
- ✅ Publish to VS Code Marketplace
- ✅ Publish to Open VSX Registry
- ✅ Create GitHub release with .vsix file
- ✅ Generate release notes

### Weekly Automation
- ✅ Dependency update PRs
- ✅ Security vulnerability scans
- ✅ CodeQL analysis

## 📦 Marketplace Publishing

Once you add the `VSCE_PAT` token, every merge to main will:

1. **Automatically publish** to VS Code Marketplace
2. **Create a GitHub release** with version tag
3. **Attach the .vsix file** for manual installation
4. **Update marketplace listing** with latest version

Your extension will be available at:
`https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ASHURTECH.NET.entitled`

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Automated dependency scanning**
- **CodeQL static analysis** 
- **npm audit** on every build
- **Dependabot alerts** for vulnerabilities
- **Branch protection** prevents direct pushes
- **Required reviews** for all changes

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Set up branch protection** (most important!)
2. **Add VSCE_PAT secret** for publishing
3. **Test the pipeline** with a sample PR
4. **Invite collaborators** if needed
5. **Monitor Actions tab** for workflow runs
